<h3>Hero Section: The Sentinel of the Nation</h3> <br>
<b>"Service Before Self" (Seva Paramo Dharmah)</b><br>
<pre>
The <b>Indian Armed Forces</b> stand as the supreme military organization of the Republic of India, charged with defending the nation's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against external threats. Comprising the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, and the Indian Air Force, this integrated force operates under the strategic command of the President of India, who is the Supreme Commander. Our strength lies in our jointmanship, professionalism, and unwavering dedication to the motto, Service Before Self.

<h2>The Three Pillars of Defense</h2><br>
India's defense strategy is secured across land, sea, and air, with each service fulfilling a critical, yet interconnected, role:<br>
<ul>
<li>🛡️ Indian Army (Bhartiya Thal Sena): The largest land-based component, responsible for ground operations, border defense, and counter-insurgency.</li>
<li>⚓ Indian Navy (Bhartiya Nausena): The maritime guardian, responsible for protecting India's vast coastline, securing Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOCs), and projecting power across the Indian Ocean Region.</li>
<li>🦅 Indian Air Force (Bhartiya Vayu Sena): The aerial protector, responsible for maintaining air superiority, defending airspace, and providing crucial strategic lift and air support.</li>
</ul><hr>
<h3>Integrated Command & Capability</h3><br>
India is committed to modern warfare synergy. Key joint structures facilitate seamless operations:<br>
<ul>
<li>Chief of Defence Staff (CDS): The principal military advisor to the Defence Minister and head of the Department of Military Affairs.</li>
<li>Integrated Theatre Commands (Planned): Future structures aimed at combining the resources of the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a single commander for specific geographical or strategic zones.</li>
<li>Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC): India's first permanent tri-service command, vital for securing the strategic island chain.</li><hr>
